## 🐍 Role of Python in API security / Infosec
---
* Python plays an essential role in infosec itself
* we can create scripts to automate stuff , such as method fuzzer , API tester 
* using GUI Library's such as *Tkinter* , it can lessen the CLI confusing experience 
* writing own scripts can be beneficial rather than using paid tools 
* however doing such requires , good knowledge of python 


## ⚒️ Small Projects to be worked on ( SOON )
---
* Port Scanner 
* Method Based Request Sender
* API Request Tool (consist of : burp cert for proxy History , content- type, etc ,  , Auth-Token , Fuzzer)
