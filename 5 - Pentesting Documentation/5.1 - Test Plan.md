## 1. Introduction to test plans 
---
* Definition of a Test plan in the context of API Pentesting 
* Importance of Test plan in ensuring a comprehensive and effective pentest 


## 2. Preparing for an API Pentest 
---
- Collect and review **API Documentation**
- Understand the functionality & data flows 
- Tools : Postman collections, Swagger files, sample requests 

---

## 3. Grey-Box pentesting
---
- Grey-box = tester has **parital knowledge** of internal systems.
- Benefits: 
	- More efficient than black-box.
	- More realistic than white-box.
* provides balance: attacker's perspective + insider hits.



## 4. OWASP API Testing Guide
---
- OWASP offers a reference framework for API testing 
- Standard methodology --> avoids guesswork



## 5. Example test plan (Hackxpert Labs)
---
### 🎯 Objective

- Find & remediate vulnerabilities in `labs.hackxpert.com` APIs.
    

### 📍 Scope

- **In Scope**: All APIs & endpoints on labs.hackxpert.com.
    
- **Out of Scope**: Third-party integrations, external systems.
    

### 🛠 Preparation

- NDA signed by testers.
    
- API docs, Postman collections, Swagger files obtained.
    

### 🔍 Methodology

- Grey-box testing approach.
    
- Use OWASP guidelines as baseline.
    

### 🚀 Execution

- Test each endpoint for common vulns:
    
    - SQL Injection
        
    - XSS
        
    - Authentication weaknesses
        
    - Misconfigurations
        
- Review auth mechanisms & access controls.
    

### 📝 Reporting

- Document all findings.
    
- Provide **risk ratings**.
    
- Suggest **remediation steps**.
    
- Deliver full report to security team.
    

### 🔄 Post-Testing

- Review effectiveness of test plan.
    
- Adjust for future tests.
    
- Conduct **lessons learned** session with all parties.
