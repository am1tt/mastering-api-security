```
1 : Executive Summary : 
	- objective : identify and remediate potential security vulnerabilities within the APIs hosted on the {http://demo.demo.com}
	- key findings : A total of 3 critical, 5 high & 7 medium severity vulnerabilities were discovered
	  
2 : Methodology: 
	- grey-box testing approach, utlizing OWASP's guidlines for API testing
	  
3 : Findings:
	1 - SQL injection (critical) 
		- endpoint:  /api/login
		- description : input validation is missing, allowing malicious sql         commands to be executed
		- evidence (POC) : sc, images, video links, 
		- impact : unauthorized access , access controls vertical
		  
	2 - Cross-Site Scripting (High):
			- endpoint /users/comments
			- description : lack of input validation, hashing, allowing                 payloads
			- evidence (POC) : sc, images, etc 
			- impact : data theft, session highjacking

4 : Recommendations
	- SQL-Injection 
	  * implement proper input validation and prepared statement to               mitigate sql injection risks 
	    
	- Cross-Site scripting
	  * implement output encoding to prevent injection of malicious scripts 
	    
5 : Appendices
	* Detailed logs of the testing process, including all the requests and      responses
	
	* Additional resource and references for securing APIs.
```

* the above is an example of test report
* will be using this template onwards in real scenarios as its perfect
