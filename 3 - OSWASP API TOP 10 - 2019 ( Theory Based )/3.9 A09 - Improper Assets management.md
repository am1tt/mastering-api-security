## 🧠 What is improper Assets management 
---
> refers to API that are forgotten , outdate or undocumented yet , still running on production environment 

* Often also called as `Shadow API'S` , operates silently in the background 
	* they are outdated libraries 
	* Lack proper security patches 
	* Might be exposed via microservices 



## 🔒 Threat Agents & Attack vectors 
---
* Vulnerability stems from : 
	* **Old API versions** : left behind
	* **Untracked third-party integerations**
	* **Lack of inventory / documentation**




## 🚨 **Impacts**

The risks range from:

- Exposure of sensitive data 😨  
    (like what we saw in **API3:2019 – Excessive Data Exposure**)
    
- All the way to **remote code execution (RCE)** or even **full server takeover** if an old, vulnerable API is still accessible. ☠️

## 🧪 **Real-World Attack Scenarios**

Let me share **two examples** from my experience 🔍:

#### 🧪 Example 1: Version Downgrade Discovery

I was testing an API that used:

`http://website.com/api/v2/resources/books/all`

I replaced `v2` with `v1` and hit gold:

`http://website.com/api/v1/admin`

The admin panel was meant to be **internal-only**, but I bypassed it using the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to trick the server into thinking I was on the local network. 

#### 🧪 Example 2: Hidden Third-Party Time Bomb

A company had integrated a third-party feature using **outdated libraries**, which included old APIs.

Due to poor asset management, they didn’t even know these APIs were there — but they exposed functionality vulnerable to **remote code execution (RCE)**. 😳

## 🛡️ **How To Prevent Improper Assets Management**

✅ **Inventory Everything**

- Track all API endpoints, versions, environments, and who can access them
    
- Don't forget **third-party integrations**!
    

✅ **Use API Specification Tools**

- Adopt OpenAPI or Swagger for **automatic documentation** 📄
    
- Make this documentation available to internal teams and API consumers
    

✅ **Set Up Retirement Plans**

- Create a lifecycle plan for APIs so outdated ones are **safely deprecated** 📅
    

✅ **Protect All Environments**

- Not just production! Secure **testing**, **staging**, and **demo** APIs too
    
- Use API gateways, rate limiting, and CORS restrictions across the board
    

✅ **Avoid Using Production Data in Dev/Test**

- Or treat it with **production-grade controls** if you must!
    

✅ **Patch & Risk Review**

- If a newer API version includes a **security fix**, prioritize rollout!  
    Don't let old versions linger.

## ✅ **Conclusion**

Improper Assets Management is like leaving **unlocked doors** in your house — you might forget they’re there, but attackers won’t. 🧠🔓

Stay organized. Track everything. Shut down what you don’t use.

Because **the APIs you forget**… are the ones hackers find first.
