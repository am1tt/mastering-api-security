## ⭕ What is it ? 
---
* This issue doesn't directly **allow attacks** - but it lets attackers *undetected*
* Without logging or monitoring
	* You won't notice intrusions 
	* You can't investigates issues 
	* No visibility = no defense

---


## 🧠 Why it happens ? 
---
* No or weak logging
* Incorrect log levels 
* Missing important details in logs 
* No monitoring setup (nobody watching the logs)
* Log injection by attackers (**eg : inserting special characters to break the log format**)
---


## ⚙️Examples
----
* #### Log Injection via CSV
```
name,lastname,test@test.com
test,test,test@test.com
test2,test2,test@test.com
test3,te,st3,test@test.com
```
* attacker inserts extra commas --> breaks parsing or monitoring tools 



## 💥 Impacts 
---
* Attackers can move slowly and quietly
* No way to trace or investigate after an incident
* Audit failure , no trails for external reviews 
* Logs can leak sensitive data if not protected



## 🔐Prevention Tips
---
* **Log Authentication Events**
	* Especially failed ones (eg `403` validation errors )
* **Use proper Log Format**
	* Match your logging system (eg, SIEM) expectations 
* **Sanitize Log inputs**
	* Prevent log injection (treat like XSS)
* **Protect Logs**
	* Encrypt + restrict access 
	* Handle logs with same care as user data 
* **Balance Logging**
	* Don't log too little (use miss threats)
	* Don't log too much (waste resource or open DoS risk)


## ✅ Conclusion 
---
* Without good logging + monitoring
	* Attackers walk in and out undetected
