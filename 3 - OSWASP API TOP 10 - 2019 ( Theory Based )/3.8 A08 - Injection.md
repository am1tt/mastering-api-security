##  💉What is Injection ? 
----
> Injection happens , when untrusted input , is sent to an interpreter (SQL , OS command etc) allowing attackers to 

* Change how the **API Behaves**
* Access or Modify data 
* Execute commands 
* Take over the system


* ### Common Types 
	* SQL injection (SQLi)
	* OS Command Injection 
	* GraphQL Injection
	* LDAP Injection 
	* etc


## 🔍 Where can injections come from ? 
---
* API Parameters ( user input ) 
* File uploads like ( `.csv` )
* 3rd party integrations ( often forgotten ! )
* Background Jobs or Batch Processing 


## 💥 Why its dangerous
---
* #### Injections attack can 
	* leak sensitive data 
	* Bypass Authentication
	* Allow remote Code Executions 
	* Lead to complete system takeover 



##  🧪Example Attack Scenario
---
* **Uploading a `.csv` with malicious input**
```
';select * from users;--
```
* App didn't sanitize import input --> full users table leaked in error message

* **OS Command injection via Parameter**
* Found `osParam` in the URL : 
```
index.php?osParam=\nPing -c 10 127.0.0.1
```
* App executed  `ping` command ---> attacker used it to run `whoami`


## 🛡️How to prevent Injection Attacks
---
* Never trusts input 
* Sanitize , validate , verify all the inputs of the API level 
* use known , and safe libraries for sanitization ( don't build your own )
* Escape special characters 
* Limit query outputs 
* use Schemas 
* Update old code 


## ✅ Conclusion 
---
> Injection flaws are common and high-risk , often overlooked in areas like

* Import features
* 3rd party integrations 
* Old / Documented endpoints
