## 🏃‍➡️ Introduction 
---
* ### Broken Object Level Authorization
	* if you request has an identifier eg 
		* `/index.php?userId=1`
		  
	* the above *eg* refers to **IDORS** (*indirect object reference*) 
		* the identifier can be manipulated according to attacker easily , which is very common in API'S
		  
	* as he can change to identifier to something like 
		* `/index.php?userId=2`



## 🕵️ Detectability and Consequences 
---
### Detectability 

* the most common vulnerability on API endpoints
  
* even a good api security integration of `authorizations` make developers forget to implement solution to such simple vulns 
  
* as typically we cannot automate access Control testing , which makes this vulns even more prevelant
  
### Consequences on Businesses

* Sensitive data leak to users that are not authorized to view or edit data 
  
* eg : `index.php?id=1` might display the *data* of user , the attacker is not allowed to **see**

* the attacker might also manipulate the data for example sending , POST or PUT request on an Object that does not have proper *access control*
	* like `changing email address of another user`

* attacker can also reset the password and take the control of the account 



## 🟰 BOLA (Broken Object level Authorization)
---
* **BOLA** all starts with an *Object*
  
* things you think about first in designing a program 
	* can be anything ranging from `account` to an `invoice` to a `credit note` and everything in between
	  
* these objects are marked with an ***identifier***
	* we need to address that these objects directly , and this is where issues can arise 
	
    * because we need to always check if the user is allowed to access the object , not as simple as it seems though  


## 🖥️ How BOLA Occurs ? 
---
* occurs when , server does not properly check the currently `logged-in` user or 
	* if a `logged-out` user can read , update or delete an *object identifier* to which they do not have right 


## 🌀 Two main types of BOLA
---
> these can occur because either a `userId` is passed on to the server or an object 

* ### Based on userID
	* eg : `google.com/get_users_search_history?userId=1234`
		* if we add other usersId and it does view the history its a ***BOLA*** issue 

* ### Solution (Mitigation)
	* to mitigate this , we need to check , that the currently logged in user is allowed to access those *objects* 

``` 
psuedo code

if($_GET['userId'] === object.ownerID){
showData()
}
else{
echo "not allowed to view the page"
wait(5s)
redirect(homepage)
}

// safest way to handle the exception 


if(!$_GET['userID'] === object.ownerId){
	echo "you are not allowed to view the data"
	wait(5s)
	Redirect(homepage)
}

Showdata() 

```

> `object.ownerID` playes major role here , as it is what matches the userID , refering to the current *logged-in* user who is only allowed to view his own id as is authorized , if someone who is not logged in or different user , cannot access the other `userId` , this mitigates the BOLA 


* ### Based on Object ID
	* `note`:  this vulnerability type can only exist , if ObjectId is passed to the *server* 
	* when server does not properly chcek if the user is authorized for object
	* also can occur when devs forgot to secure the resource of the objects 
* ```
```
GET product.php?id=12 for getting details

POST product.php?id=12 for updating the prod details

DELETE product.php?id=12 to delete a product 

OPTIONS
```

* The problem is that the developers forgot to check if the user is allowed to write to that product with id=1 and the attacker can overwrite product details of products that do not belong to them
  
```
POST updateProduct.php?productID?id=1 
if($_GET['productID'].owner === object.ownerID)
{ 
UpdateData() }
else{
 echo "You are not allowed to view this data" wait(5s) Redirect(Homepage) }
  POST /import.php? StartUpdateData()
```

* in the above code , we can see the describe vulnerability in action
