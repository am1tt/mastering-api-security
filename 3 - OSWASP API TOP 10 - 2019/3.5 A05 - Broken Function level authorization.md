## ü§î What is it ? 
---
> This vulnerability occurs when an API doesn't properly check who is *authorized* to perform what actions , while users maybe authenticated , they may still be able to 

 * Access *functions* and *endpoints* which they shouldn't (e.g, admin-only features)
 * *Elevate privilages* (eg, switching account s from regular user to admin)
 * *Manipulate HTTP methods* , parameters , or URLs to access restricted functions 

---

##  ‚ö†Ô∏èWhy it happens ? 
---
* Complex users roles and privilages
* Poorly implemented or missing authorization checks 
* Developers as always relying on client-side code , assuming endpoints will not be misused
* Predictables API endpoints patterns like `/user` and `/admin` or `GET` and `POST` as the attacker has a large payload its easier to predict 


## üîì Example Attack 
---
* ### 1. Privilege Escalation via parameter changes 
	* a user changes their account type by modifying hidden parameters 
	* `{ "Account:Type":"administrator"`

* ### 2. Accessing Hidden Admin Endpoint
	* Normal users can access `/api/documents/export`
	* But manually trying `/api/documents/export/all` returns all document , which should be accessible to admins only 

* ### 3. Using unauthorized HTTP methods 
	* A `DELETE` method might be enabled when only `GET` was meant to be accessible to normal users 


## üõ°Ô∏è Preventative Measures 
---
* Deny all access by **default** . then allow only whats needed for that role 
* use a **centralized authorization module** (preferable outside main logic)
* perform regular testing of authorization logic 
* use master admin roles to consolidate sensitive functions 
* Always validate 
	* User group
	* User authorization level 


## üéØ Key Takeaways 
---
* Attackers can guess or manipulate URLS , Params , HTTP methods to access forbidden functionality
* These flaws often lead to **vertical privilege escalation** (from user to admin basically)
* Always implement strict **role-based access control** (RBAC) form test thoroughly
