## üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Excessive Data Exposure
---
> when an API returns more data than it should , even if the frontend hides it , attackers can still access it , eg : Mitm , Reverse engineering

* Backend sends too much data (including *sensitive one*) 
* Frontend filters it , but still exposed in the response 
* Common mistake : using *generic API* , that returns full `Objects` (eg : *to_json( )*)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Why its a problem ? 
---
* **Hard to detect** : Automation struggles to distinguish sensitive data vs non sensitive ones
  
* **Often Overlooked** : Devs trust *frontend* to hide the data
  
* **Sensitive Data Leaks** : Credit card info , PII 
  
* **High Business Impact** : Could lead to data breaches


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Example Attack scenario 
---
* ###  Credit Card info leak
	* `GET /api/v1/cards?id=0`
		* the above we learned previously its an Object leak or identifier leak , where we learned , that to fix this we have to use complex jwt 

* ### Returned Data
```
{
  "CVV": "677",
  "creditCard": "1234567901234",
  "id": 0,
  "user": "API",
  "validUntil": "1992"
}
```

* **CVV** is exposed in the API *response* , even if the *frontend hides it !*

* ### Comment Medeta with PII
	* `GET /api/articles/5/comments/0

* ### Returned Data :
```
{
  "comment": "Nice article!",
  "user": "testUser",
  "user address": "testlane, testing - 340043 testland",
  "user email": "test@bla.com"
}
```
* users Address and email are leaked ,though not required for displaying a comment


## üõ°Ô∏èPreventative Measures 
---
* 1 : Never rely on *frontend* to filter data 
* 2 : Review all API Responses 
* 3 : understand consumers 
* 4 : avoid full object return (eg : `to_json()` *or* `to_string()`)
* 5 : Return only specific Fields 
* 6 : Classify and audit PII regularly 



## ‚úÖ Conclusion 
---
* this vulnerability is easy to miss
* Automation tools cant full catch this , requires a *manual view*
* Always minimize the exposures from the *server side*
