## 🤔 What is it ? 
---
> Mass Assignments happens when the API Automatically accepts and applies to many input fields (Properties) , including ones the user shouldn't be allowed to change


## 🧠 Overview
---
You're allowed to update your `name` or `email` - but if you also include `isAdmin:true` in your request and the system **doesn't block it** , you become *admin* 

---

## ⁉️ Why does this happens 
---
* Many frameworks automatically map incoming request fields to backend objects (like user accounts , products , etc )
* if dev's don't control which fields can be edited , attackers can sneak in dangerous ones like 
	* `isAdmin`
	* `WalletBalance`
	* `productPrice`


## 💥 Real-world example 
----
* You book a 1-hour appointment
*```
```
{
 "startDate": "2022-01-01 10:00",
  "endDate": "2022-01-01 11:00"
}
```

* Then you change the `endDate` to **2099** : 

```
{
  "startDate": "2022-01-01 10:00",
  "endDate": "2099-12-31 23:59"
}
```

> well suddenly , you blocked the consultant's calendar for the next 75 years !



## 🔒How to prevent it ? 
---
* **1.** use a **WhiteList** - allow only specific fields to be edited
* **2.** Don't use auto-bind all input to objects 
* **3.** Regularly test if sensitive fields can be updated 
* **4.** Use your framework built-in protection (not custom code btw)

## ⚠️ Impact
---
* Gaining **unauthorized access** (admin , discounts, hidden features, bypassing paywalls)
* Modify Protected data 
* Break business logic (like booking ahead far , and skipping payments and required authentications)
