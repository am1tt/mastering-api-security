## 🧠What is it ? 
---
> when an API doesn't limit how many times , a client / user can make *requests* at a given time , it becomes vulnerable 

* **Denial of Service** (DOS)
* **Brute-force attacks** (eg : password reset abuse)
* **Resource exhaustion** (especially in cloud based enviroments)

---

##  ⚠️ Threats & Weakness
---
* Attackers can flood API'S with request 
* **no rate limit** = System runs out of CPU and RAM , bandwidth and disk
* Many API'S share *same server* , so one vulnerable endpoint can affect others 
* **Dynamic cloud scaling** can lead to huge bills if abused


##  💥Real - world impacts
---
* **DOS** : api becomes un-usable for user
* **Password brute-forcing** : attackers abuse endpoints like `/reset-password`
* **Resource waste** : costs rise from unmonitored scalling
* Business Disruption and downtime


## 🧪 Example Attack Scenario 
----
* ### 1. File copy attack
	* endpoint `/createDocument.php` is **rate-limited**
	* endpoint `/cloneDocument.php?id=3` is **not**
	* Attacker uploads a *huge file* . then clones it repeatedly = server resource overload

* ### 2. Massive Data request
```
GET /api/v1/posts?limit=1000000
```
* API doesn't restrict the `limit` parameter
* Returns too much data --> memory / CPU Crashes


## 🛡️Preventative Measures 
---
* ### Basic Protections
	* Apply **Rate limiting** on all *endpoints* (especially sensitive ones)
	* Notify clients when they are approaching limits (eg  via headers or error responses)

* ### Resource control 
	* use Docker memory limits (`-m` flag) to prevent container overuse
	* Cap Request sizes and **response data volumes**
		* example : dont allow `limit=99999` or massive file uploads 
	* restrict data types
		* example : Max integer input = `5999`

* ### Server side validation 
	* validate input sizes on the server side
	* Limit the client control over params that fetch bulk data 



## 💁‍♂️ Key takeaway
---
* every API should define **limits** (request / minutes , size, etc)
* protect high risk endpoints such as login , reset-password , file processing
* and offcourse **rate limiting** is crucial for both security and cost efficiency
