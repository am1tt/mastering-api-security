## üß† What is Broken User Authentication ? 
---
* `Broken User Authentication` : occurs when authentication mechanisms in an API are incorrectly implemented allowing attackers to : 
	* take over user accounts 
	  
	* access private data
	   
	* impersonate users


## ‚≠ï Common Causes and weakness 
---
 * ### Credentials Stuffing 
	 * attackers use leaked credentials (user/pass)
	 * works due to password reuse
	 * **fix** : implement rate-limiting & Lockout mechanism

* ### No Captcha
	* failing to challenge suspicious login attempts (eg bots)
	* **fix** : use CAPTCHA where appropriate

* ### Weak password policies
	* allowing short simple passwords 
	* **fix** : enforce strong password policies 

* ### Sensitive data in URL (get params)
	* sending passwords / tokens via url can be exposed in logs or shared systems 
	* **fix** : use POST methods and keep sensitive data in body
* ### some more 
	* not using `jwt`
	* weak encryptions keys 
	* weak validations 




## üß™ Example Attack Scenarios
---
* ### Password reset bruteforce
	* `api/v1/reset-password` triggers a reset with a 4 digit token
	* no rate limiting -> attacker tries all 0000-9999 combinations 
	* Result : attack resets user password

```
POST 
/api/v1/reset-password-token
 {
  userID=123
   tokenID=xxxx
    newPass=test
     }
```


##  üõ°Ô∏è Preventative Measure
---
* Map all the Authentication flows
	* web , mobile , deep links , SSO etc 

* Understand Auth protocols 
	* don't blindy implement OAuth2 / OpenID 

* use Trusted Auth Libraries 
	* Avoid writing custom auth logic 

* Rate limiting + Lockout
	* protect login & reset-password endpoints 

* Use MFA 
	* Auth APPS , SMS , Hardware



## ‚úÖ TL;DR 
---
* Authentication endpoint must be hardened more than regular endpoints
* Protect against bruteforce , credential stuffing , token abuse 
* use Strong , Standardized mechanisms and always validate securely 
* when in doubt , consult OWASP Auth Cheatsheet
