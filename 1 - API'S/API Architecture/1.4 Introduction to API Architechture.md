## 🔁 Stateful vs Stateless APIs

- **Stateful**:
- Stores session info.
- More vulnerable to session-based attacks.
- Example: `SOAP API`, e-commerce cart stored server-side.

- **Stateless**:
- Every request is independent.
- No session tracking.
- More scalable and secure.
- Example: `REST APIs`.

---

## 🧬 API Versioning

- Versions matter:
- Older versions may have known vulns.
- Microservices maintain **independent versions**.
- Attack Surface:
- Scan old versions (`/api/v1`, `/api/v2`)  
- Automate fuzzing with scripts.

---

## 🔗 WebSockets & APIs

- Requires an initial **handshake** (request/response).
- Once open, stays persistent (bidirectional comm).
- Use-case: **Chat apps**, **real-time dashboards**.
- Tool: Burp Suite has good WebSocket support.

---

## 🚦 Rate Limiting & Throttling

- Critical for **DoS protection**, **abuse prevention**.
- Should be granular:
- `/login` → lower threshold
- `/public/posts` → higher threshold
- Harder in **monolithic** APIs due to lack of separation.

---

## 🚀 Caching Mechanisms in APIs

- Improves performance and speed.
- Types:
- Memory caching
- CDN-based caching
- Security risks:
- **Cache Poisoning**
- **State data leakage**
- Follow **secure caching headers** (`Cache-Control`, `ETag`, etc.)

---

## 📦 Containerization (Docker, etc.)

- APIs can be packaged into **containers**.
- Pros:
- Portability
- Scalability
- Risks:
- Misconfigured Dockerfiles
- Public containers with secrets

---

## ⚖️ Load-Balanced APIs

- Handles heavy traffic by distributing load.
- Microservices can be **replicated**.
- Tools: Nginx, HAProxy, AWS ELB, etc.
